# Malicious URL Detection with Large Language Models
This repository is a file collection comprising my Bachelor Semester Project developed during Semester 6 at the University of Luxembourg (February 2024 - June 2024).

The project assesses the feasibility of using large language models to identify malicious URLs, combining concepts from cyber threat intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing. This involves utilizing Python to fine-tune different LLMs and analyze their ability to differentiate between benign and harmful URLs.
