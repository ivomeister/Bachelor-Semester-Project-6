A Jupyter notebook environment should be used for file execution

The latest Python 3 version is recommended

Note that should the files with the BERT and DistilBERT implementations be run, there could be a significant time until execution finishes as the fine-tuning for each is relatively computationally expensive (not as much for DistilBERT, since it is more lightweight)
